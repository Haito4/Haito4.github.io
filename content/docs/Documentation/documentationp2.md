# 3. **Implementation of Software Solutions**
----

## **Interface Design**
### **The Design of Individual Screens**
#### Identifying Data Required

Describes How System will store/manipulate this data

In the designing of the interface for my effects processor, I needed to ensure that all of the necessary data was provided to the user in an easy-to-read form.

#### The Design of Effective User Friendly Interface

During the development of the graphics user interface (GUI), I proceeded with a focus on the recreation of the source material - my reference pedals and amplifiers. This was to ensure that each point in the signal chain was clearly diffrentiable from each other to allow the solution to simpler to understand and hence easier to use.

Takes into account the ergonomic issues of software design (e.g. consistency, alignment, white space, use of colour and font appropriately, correct use of screen elements, use of standards).

#### help screens (ensuring it meets the intended audience)
To ensure an accessible experience for all users, I needed to include a help screen, explaining how to use the different features of the audio plugin, and what they do.

- Tooltips
- Worded examples
- Example Presets
- Popup video tooltips


#### Level, Social, Ethical Issues

design constructed addresses the legal, social and ethical issues identified in Section I.

## **Program Development & Techniques**
### **Code generation**
(structured approach)

I approached code generation in a structured manner, where each subroutine possesses one logical task.

one logical task per subroutine

debugging output statements

elegance of solution

comments

flags 

stubs


### **Process of detecting and correcting errors**
Throughout the development of my software solution, I took various steps to detect and correct errors in the source code. By executing these processes, I could ensure that the reliability of the code and thus the stability of the software solution was to a high standard.

## **Reporting on the testing process**
Apply appropriate development methods to solve software problems by providing:
Documentation and communication of the test data/results and output produced. (Test requirements, test plan, test data and expected results, test results, and recommendations of how the solve the problem).

- Test plans

- Test results

- recommendations of how the solve the problem
