# 3. **Implementation of Software Solutions**
----

## **Interface Design**

In the designing of the interface for my effects processor, I needed to ensure that all of the necessary data was provided to the user in an easy-to-read form.


### **The Design of Individual Screens**

#### Identifying Data Required

Describes How System will store/manipulate this data

#### the design of effective user friendly interface

During the development of the graphics user interface (GUI), I proceeded with a focus on the recreation of the source material - my reference pedals and amplifiers. This was to ensure that each point in the signal chain was clearly diffrentiable from each other to allow the solution to simpler to understand and hence easier to use.

#### help screens (ensuring it meets the intended audience)
...

#### design constructed addresses the legal, social and ethical issues identified in Section I.

## **Program Development & Techniques**

### **Code generation: structured approach (one logical task per subroutine), debugging output statements, elegance of solution, comments, flags, stubs.**

I approached code generation in a structured manner, where each subroutine possesses one logical task.


### **Process of detecting and correcting errors: (syntax, logic, peer checking, desk checking, use of expected output, runtime errors.**
...

### **The use of software debugging tools**
resetting variable contents, program traces, single line stepping.

## **Documentation**



### **User documentation**

installation guide, user manual, tutorial, online help.

### **Technical documentation**

source code, updated and/or additional algorithms, updated data dictionary and the use of intrinsic documentation.
